When image is building when there is first step that there was any change (like changing application.yaml) any step after that is gonna be ran instead of using cache.\nReference: https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#leverage-build-cache\n\nAs far as I know it is also useful for pulling and pushing images because layers are also reused.",
